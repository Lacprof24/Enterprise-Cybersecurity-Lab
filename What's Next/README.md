#  What's Next?

With the foundational Blue Team, Red Team, and Vulnerable Environment setups complete, here are some practical next steps to deepen and expand this cybersecurity lab project.

---

## 1. Enhance Detection Capabilities

- Integrate **Sysmon** on Windows hosts to collect detailed process, network, and file event data.  
- Deploy **Suricata** or **Zeek** as Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) for network traffic monitoring.  
- Customize and fine-tune **Wazuh** rules to reduce false positives and improve alert accuracy.

---

## 2. Expand Attack Simulations

- Practice advanced techniques such as:  
  - Privilege escalation within the Windows domain  
  - Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket attacks  
  - Phishing and social engineering simulations  
- Use automation frameworks like **Metasploit** or **Cobalt Strike** for realistic adversary emulation.

---

## 3. Improve Defensive Controls

- Enforce strong password policies and access control via Group Policy.  
- Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems.  
- Configure account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

---

## 4. Centralize Logging & Monitoring

- Integrate a **SIEM** solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) for centralized log aggregation and analysis.  
- Build dashboards and automated reports to track attack trends and system health.

---

## 5. Automate Incident Response

- Develop response playbooks for common attack scenarios.  
- Incorporate **SOAR** tools to automate containment and remediation workflows.

---

## 6. Cloud Lab Extension

- Deploy a cloud-based lab environment (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to explore cloud-native security monitoring.  
- Experiment with cloud detection tools like AWS GuardDuty or Azure Sentinel.
